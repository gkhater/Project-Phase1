# AUBoutique

## Overview

AUBoutique is a basic client-server app that lets users sign up, log in, browse, buy, and sell products. It also allows users to message each other while theyâ€™re logged in.

## How It Works

- **Client**: The client app connects to the server, letting users register, log in, view products, and chat with others. 
- **Server**: The server keeps track of users, products, and messages. It handles user sign-ups, logins, and lets users buy or add products to the marketplace.

## Features

- **User Registration & Login**: New users can sign up, and existing users can log in to access their account.
- **Product Management**: Users can add items for sale, browse available products, and buy items listed by others.
- **Messaging**: Users can send messages to other online users.

## Project Files

- **Client/main.py**: The client-side program where users interact with the app.
- **Server/main.py**: The main server program that manages connections and operations.
- **Server/Messages.py**: Stores the different messages and prompts displayed to users.
- **Server/Products.py**: Handles everything related to products (add, buy, view).
- **Server/Users.py**: Manages user accounts, including registration and login.

## Getting Started

1. **Run the Server**: Start the server first by running `Server/main.py`.
2. **Run the Client**: Connect clients to the server by running `Client/main.py`. Make sure `port` corresponds to the port you chose while activating the server.
