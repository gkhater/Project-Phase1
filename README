# AUBoutique

AUBoutique is a project that integrates a backend database (Python + sqlite) with a Node.js-based frontend. The platform provides users with a secure and interactive environment for managing items, making purchases, chatting with online users, and more.

## Features
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Secure login using OTP generated by your favorite authenticator app (e.g., Microsoft Authenticator).
- **Item Management**: Deposit, buy, and add items to your account.
- **Real-Time Chat**: Connect with online users through the built-in chat.
   NOTE: For the best possible experience chatting, make sure to test it using two different devices (You might want to change the source IP from 127.0.0.1 to you local IP address). 
- **Advanced Search**: Easily find items available on the platform.
- **Intuitive User Flow**: Smooth interaction between the backend and frontend.

## Prerequisites
- Python (latest version recommended)
- Node.js and npm installed
- Microsoft Authenticator (or your favorite authenticator) for OTP generation

## Installation & Usage

### Step 1: Set up the Backend
1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have all required Python files.
3. Run the Python backend:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   - The app will prompt you to enter the port you'll be listening on (e.g., `5001`). 
   NOTE: Make sure this port number matches the port number you are connecting to on your frontend (Connect To server function). 

### Step 2: Set up the Frontend
1. Navigate to the project directory and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   - This installs all necessary libraries for the Node.js frontend.

2. Start the frontend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## How to Use the Application
1. **Sign Up**:
   - Use your favorite authenticator app (e.g., Microsoft Authenticator) to scan the provided QR code.
   - Enter the generated OTP to complete the sign-up process.

2. **Log In**:
   - Use the OTP displayed on your authenticator app. Note that the OTP changes every 30 seconds for enhanced security.

3. **Explore Features**:
   - Deposit items to your account.
   - Buy and add new items.
   - Chat with online users in real-time.
   - Search for items using advanced search capabilities.

## Notes
1. **Self-Purchases**: 
   - If you buy an item listed for sale under your account, there will be no change in your balance. This is intentional, as you are both the buyer and the seller: To observe the change in balance please create two separate accounts for buyer and seller. 

2. **Server Connection**:
   - Once again, make sure that all port numbers sent to the frontend match with those sent to the backend, or this might mess with the messaging.
